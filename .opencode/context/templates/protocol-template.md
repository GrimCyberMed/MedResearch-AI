2. Bias due to deviations from intended interventions
3. Bias due to missing outcome data
4. Bias in measurement of the outcome
5. Bias in selection of the reported result

**Judgments**: Low risk / Some concerns / High risk

[If using other study designs, specify appropriate tool: ROBINS-I for observational, QUADAS-2 for diagnostic, etc.]

## 10. Data Synthesis and Analysis

### Descriptive Synthesis
- Study characteristics will be summarized in tables
- Population, intervention, and outcome characteristics will be described narratively

### Meta-Analysis

**Conditions for Meta-Analysis**:
- Clinical homogeneity (similar PICO)
- Methodological similarity (comparable study designs)
- Outcome consistency (same or similar measures)
- Sufficient data (≥3 studies per outcome)

**Effect Measures**:
- **Continuous outcomes**: Standardized mean difference (SMD) using Hedges' g
  - [If same scale used across studies: Mean difference (MD)]
- **Binary outcomes**: Risk ratio (RR)
  - [Alternative: Odds ratio (OR) if appropriate]

**Meta-Analysis Model**:
- **Primary**: Random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird or REML method)
  - Rationale: Anticipate heterogeneity across studies (different populations, settings, intervention characteristics)
- **Sensitivity**: Fixed-effect model (inverse variance method)
  - To assess robustness of findings

**Statistical Software**:
- R (meta package) version [X.X]
- [Alternative: RevMan 5.4, Stata, etc.]

### Heterogeneity Assessment

**Statistical Measures**:
- **I² statistic**: Percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance
  - Interpretation: 0-40% (might not be important), 30-60% (moderate), 50-90% (substantial), 75-100% (considerable)
- **Tau² (τ²)**: Variance of true effects across studies
- **Cochran's Q test**: Statistical test for heterogeneity (p<0.10 indicates significant heterogeneity)

**Prediction Interval**:
- 95% prediction interval will be calculated to show range of true effects in future studies

**Investigation of Heterogeneity**:
- Visual inspection of forest plots
- Subgroup analysis (see below)
- Meta-regression (if ≥10 studies)
- Sensitivity analysis (see below)

### Subgroup Analysis (Pre-Specified)

**Subgroups**:
1. **Depression Severity**:
   - Mild-moderate vs Severe
   - Rationale: Treatment response may differ by severity

2. **Intervention Format**:
   - Individual vs Group
   - Rationale: Different mechanisms and effectiveness

3. **Delivery Mode**:
   - In-person vs Online
   - Rationale: Accessibility and effectiveness may differ

4. **Treatment Duration**:
   - Short (6-8 sessions) vs Long (≥12 sessions)
   - Rationale: Dose-response relationship

**Statistical Test**:
- Test for subgroup differences using Q-test (p<0.10 indicates significant difference)

**Interpretation**:
- Subgroup analyses will be interpreted cautiously as observational
- Credibility will be assessed using ICEMAN criteria

### Sensitivity Analysis (Pre-Specified)

**Analyses**:
1. **Risk of Bias**:
   - Exclude studies with high risk of bias or some concerns
   - Compare to all studies

2. **Study Design**:
   - RCTs only vs all study types (if non-RCTs included)

3. **Statistical Model**:
   - Fixed-effect vs random-effects

4. **Effect Measure**:
   - [If applicable: RR vs OR, Cohen's d vs Hedges' g]

5. **Outliers**:
   - Exclude studies with extreme effect sizes (>3 SD from mean)

6. **Missing Data**:
   - Complete case vs imputed data (if applicable)

**Interpretation**:
- Results will be considered robust if sensitivity analyses yield similar conclusions

### Publication Bias Assessment

**Methods** (if ≥10 studies):
1. **Funnel Plot**: Visual inspection for asymmetry
2. **Egger's Test**: Statistical test for funnel plot asymmetry (p<0.10 indicates asymmetry)
3. **Trim-and-Fill**: Impute missing studies and estimate adjusted effect
4. **PET-PEESE**: Regression-based correction for small-study effects

**Interpretation**:
- Publication bias will be considered in GRADE certainty assessment
- Results will be interpreted cautiously if strong evidence of bias

### Certainty of Evidence (GRADE)

**Domains**:
1. **Risk of Bias**: Limitations in study design and execution
2. **Inconsistency**: Unexplained heterogeneity
3. **Indirectness**: Differences in PICO from review question
4. **Imprecision**: Wide confidence intervals, small sample size
5. **Publication Bias**: Evidence of selective reporting

**Rating**:
- **High**: Very confident in effect estimate
- **Moderate**: Moderately confident; true effect likely close to estimate
- **Low**: Limited confidence; true effect may differ substantially
- **Very Low**: Very little confidence; true effect likely substantially different

**Presentation**:
- GRADE evidence profile (table with ratings and justifications)
- Summary of findings table (key outcomes with certainty ratings)

## Notes for Protocol Agent

**Usage Instructions**:
1. Replace all [bracketed placeholders] with specific information from user input and PICO/SPIDER framework
2. Delete sections not applicable to review type (e.g., SPIDER if using PICO)
3. Ensure all pre-specified analyses are clearly defined (no vague statements like "we may conduct subgroup analysis")
4. Verify all required PROSPERO fields are completed
5. Ensure protocol is detailed enough to be reproducible
6. Include rationale for all methodological decisions
7. Pre-specify all subgroup and sensitivity analyses (no post-hoc analyses without clear labeling)
8. Ensure GRADE assessment plan is clear

**Quality Checks**:

- No grey literature search
- Single reviewer for screening/extraction
- No risk of bias assessment
- Post-hoc subgroup analyses (not pre-specified)
- No GRADE assessment
