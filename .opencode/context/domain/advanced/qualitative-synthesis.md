# Qualitative Evidence Synthesis - Advanced Methodology Guide

## Overview
Qualitative evidence synthesis systematically searches for, appraises, and synthesizes qualitative research to answer questions about experiences, perspectives, meanings, and implementation. Unlike quantitative reviews, the goal is understanding and interpretation rather than statistical pooling.

## When to Use Qualitative Synthesis

### Appropriate Research Questions
- **Experiences**: "What are patients' experiences of living with chronic pain?"
- **Perspectives**: "How do healthcare providers view telemedicine?"
- **Barriers/Facilitators**: "What factors influence medication adherence?"
- **Implementation**: "How is a new intervention implemented in practice?"
- **Meanings**: "What does 'quality of life' mean to cancer survivors?"

### Types of Qualitative Synthesis

**1. Meta-Ethnography**
- Interpretive approach
- Translates concepts across studies
- Develops new interpretations

**2. Thematic Synthesis**
- Systematic approach
- Codes findings line-by-line
- Develops descriptive and analytical themes

**3. Framework Synthesis**
- Uses a priori framework
- Maps findings to framework
- Identifies gaps

**4. Meta-Aggregation**
- Pragmatic approach
- Aggregates findings
- Develops recommendations

**5. Critical Interpretive Synthesis**
- Theory-driven
- Challenges assumptions
- Develops new theoretical insights

## Research Question Framework

## Data Extraction

### What to Extract

**Study Characteristics**:
- Authors, year, country
- Setting (e.g., hospital, community)
- Participants (n, demographics)
- Phenomenon of interest
- Data collection method
- Analysis method

**Findings**:
- **First-order constructs**: Participant quotes
- **Second-order constructs**: Author interpretations
- **Themes**: Main themes or categories
- **Subthemes**: Supporting themes

**Example**:
```
Theme: "Living with uncertainty"
Subtheme 1: "Fear of complications"
  - Quote: "I'm always worried about going blind" (P5)
  - Author interpretation: "Participants expressed anxiety about future complications"
Subtheme 2: "Unpredictable blood sugar"
  - Quote: "Some days it's fine, other days it's all over the place" (P12)
```

### Extraction Process
- Extract verbatim quotes and author interpretations
- Maintain context (who said it, in what context)
- Note contradictions or negative cases
- Use qualitative software (NVivo, MAXQDA) or spreadsheets

## Synthesis Methods

### Thematic Synthesis (Most Common)

**Step 1: Line-by-Line Coding**
- Code each finding (quote or interpretation)
- Stay close to original text (descriptive codes)
- Use qualitative software or spreadsheets

**Step 2: Develop Descriptive Themes**
- Group similar codes
- Create hierarchical structure
- Describe what studies found

**Step 3: Generate Analytical Themes**
- Go beyond original studies
- Develop new interpretations
- Answer review question

**Example**:
```
Descriptive Theme: "Challenges with medication"
  - Codes: forgetting pills, side effects, cost, complexity

Analytical Theme: "Medication burden as barrier to adherence"
  - Interpretation: Multiple medication-related challenges create cumulative burden that undermines adherence
```

### Meta-Ethnography

**Step 1: Getting Started**
- Define research question
- Identify relevant studies

**Step 2: Deciding What is Relevant**
- Purposive sampling of studies
- Theoretical saturation

**Step 3: Reading the Studies**
- Repeated reading
- Note key concepts and metaphors

**Step 4: Determining How Studies are Related**
- Compare concepts across studies
- Identify reciprocal (similar), refutational (contradictory), or line-of-argument (developmental) relationships

**Step 5: Translating Studies**
- Translate concepts from one study to another
- Preserve meanings

**Step 6: Synthesizing Translations**
- Develop overarching concepts
- Create new interpretations

**Step 7: Expressing the Synthesis**
- Write up synthesis
- Use metaphors or models

### Framework Synthesis

**Step 1: Develop Framework**
- Use existing theory or model
- Or develop from initial studies

**Step 2: Code Data to Framework**
- Map findings to framework components
- Note data that doesn't fit

**Step 3: Refine Framework**
- Modify framework based on data
- Add new components if needed

**Step 4: Interpret Findings**
- Describe patterns
- Identify gaps

## Assessing Confidence: GRADE-CERQual

### Components

**1. Methodological Limitations**
- Quality of included studies (CASP)
- Concerns: Serious / Moderate / Minor / No concerns

**2. Coherence**
- How clear and convincing is the fit between data and finding?
- Concerns: Serious / Moderate / Minor / No concerns

**3. Adequacy of Data**
- Richness and quantity of data
- Concerns: Serious / Moderate / Minor / No concerns

**4. Relevance**
- Applicability to review question
- Concerns: Serious / Moderate / Minor / No concerns

### Confidence Ratings
- **High**: High confidence finding is reasonable representation
- **Moderate**: Moderate confidence
- **Low**: Low confidence
- **Very Low**: Very low confidence

### Example

**Finding**: "Patients experience medication burden as barrier to adherence"

**Assessment**:
- Methodological limitations: Minor concerns (mostly high-quality studies)
- Coherence: No concerns (clear pattern across studies)
- Adequacy: No concerns (20 studies, rich data)
- Relevance: Minor concerns (mostly hospital settings, review includes primary care)

**Confidence**: Moderate (downgraded for relevance)

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Treating as quantitative**: Counting themes instead of interpreting
❌ **Superficial synthesis**: Just summarizing studies, not developing new insights
❌ **Ignoring context**: Decontextualizing quotes
❌ **Cherry-picking**: Selecting only supportive quotes
❌ **No quality appraisal**: Including all studies without critical appraisal
❌ **Unclear methods**: Not describing synthesis process clearly
❌ **No reflexivity**: Not acknowledging reviewer perspectives and biases
